An AIR application to visualize Notification-flows in any AS3 PureMVC (Multicore) application at runtime.

Currently in very early stage, so with the following limitations:
  * only works for PureMVC multicore setup.
  * only captures Notifications, Commands and Mediators (no proxies).
  * compiled AIR-app (in downloadable zip) is OSX only.
